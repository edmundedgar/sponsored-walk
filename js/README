The JavaScript used for this app can be managed with node.js.

Build it from inside the js/ directory with:
npm run build
This will create a file called bundle.js under dist/ that is referenced by the HTML pages.

The HTML pages also reference a file called populate.js, which is not kept in bundle.js.

Run tests with:
npm test
